200 samples of a digits is taken(I took digit 3). Then the feature vector is
extracted by projecting the centred data points on PCAs. The program calculates
the value of k i.e number of PCAs that needs to be considered in ordered to get
x% of original date. ![alt

For 100%, k = 240 out of 240 ![alt

For 99.9% k = 58 out of 240 PCAs needs to be considered ![alt

For 99% k = 23 out 240 PCAs needs to be considered ![alt

For 95% k = 23 out of 240 PCAs needs to be considered

For 80%, k = 10 out of 240 PCAs needs to be considered

For 50% of data recovery, k = 2 out PCAs needs to be considered.
