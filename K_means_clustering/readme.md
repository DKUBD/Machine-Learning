 K Means Clustering::: 200 samples of each digits 2 and 5 are choosen and implemented to cluster the 240 dimentional image vector in K = 4 groups. The result of the code can be seen in k_means_clustering.png image. The 10 images of each clusters are printed in each rows. The algorithms works with few missclassifications.\\
