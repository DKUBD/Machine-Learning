**What is LDA?**

LDA is a dimension reduction technique that maximize the variance between classes while minimizing the variance in the classes. Which means, data points in same classes will be close to each other while data points from different classes will be far away from each other.

**Why you should LDA?**

LDA can used for feature extraction (using dimension reduction), since LDA is supervised algorithm, it can do classification as well and LDA can be used for data visualization.

**When to use the LDA?**

**For feature extraction of the classification**, you should have a large and representative (small dataset that accurately represents the larger data set) data set. If the data set is not representative and has not enough data points. LDA will not generalize well and the projection of the tests data will be not optimal, even though train data separated well. 

**For visualization** LDA can be used all the time.
