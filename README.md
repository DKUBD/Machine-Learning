# Machine-Learning 
This repository contains some of the machine learning scripts that I have
implemented as a part of Machine Learning coursework.

*    [Training MLPs for XOR function with Single Hidden Layer using BackPropagation](https://github.com/aerolalit/Machine-Learning/tree/master/NeuralNetworks%20for%20XOR%20func)

*	[Caracter recognigation using RBF features](https://github.com/aerolalit/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Character%20Recogination_using_RBF_features)

*	[K-means Clustering](https://github.com/aerolalit/Machine-Learning/tree/master/K_means_clustering)

*	[Linear Regresstion](https://github.com/aerolalit/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Linear_Regression)
